Custom Parts, Edited Parts, and Personal Module Manager Paches to make my installation of Kerbal Space Program the best it can be. The goal is simple, make the game play how I feel it should work. Part progression is effected quite a bit and is revised quite often due to the fact that KSP is still being actively developed (at the time of writing this) along with the fact that I also like to change things up a bit.

Some things are much more realistic and some things are even less realistic than the stock game. Reason being, as stated above, I like to try out different gameplay and playstyles quite a bit.

If someone should find this repository and wonders what it's about, hopefully this will answer that question.
