NearFuture uses its own version of "LqdHydrogen" instead of the one packaged with the "CommunityResourcePack".

It's "RESOURCE_DEFINITION" should look like this:

RESOURCE_DEFINITION
{
  name = LqdHydrogen
  density = 0.000625
  unitCost = 0.5
  hsp = 9690 
  vsp = 448500 
  flowMode = STACK_PRIORITY_SEARCH
  transfer = PUMP
  isTweakable = true
  isVisible = true
}
