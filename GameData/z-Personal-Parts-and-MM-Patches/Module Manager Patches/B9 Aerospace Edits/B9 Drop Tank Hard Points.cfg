	@description = Structural part designed to provide a hardpoint for fuel drop tanks. Designed to hold an external fuel tank to the underside of an aircraft, and, when emptied, discarded to shed weight. This is accomplished by having a small explosive charge to shear the connection to the parent aircraft. This particular type is designed in two form factors (raked and straight), giving you more freedom in design.
