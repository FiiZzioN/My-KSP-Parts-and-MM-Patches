	@description = The Universal Resource Kit provides extra resources for spacecraft that normally would not be able to handle. What I mean by "handle" is, for the most part, if you add enough fuel to a space probe to actually be useful, you may as well spray paint it neon green with pink signs saying "LOOK AT ME". This allows the user to make a beautiful looking probe and also have it be a very functional craft. As you now know, this handy thing allows for more fuel without the tank, but what else can it do? It can allow you to make a heavier spacecraft by equipping a few dumbbells to the side. This means you you'll finally have a reason to build, and use, a larger rocket without having a few thousand Delta-V in excess just because you wanted to launch a bigger rocket! Another cool feature is that you can Fire Engineers on the project to make the entire craft much, much cheaper. In all seriousness though, I implemented this because if I pick a contract saying, place satellite [X] in orbit [Y], I'm looking at it as I'm just the launch provider, not the satellite manufacturer AND the launch provider. This way, I have the ability to take off however many funds that the spacecraft costs, and only pay for the rocket just as a launch provider would IRL.

	@description = The Environmental Control System (ECS) is a necessary piece of equipment that any ship with inhabitants should include. By design, the ECS is made to support three (3) Kerbals for seven (7) days. While the ECS can be used to support more than three (3) inhabitants at a time, be aware that the longevity of the system will be decreased exponentially. Also included in the ECS are things such as an Oxygen Scrubber using the Bosch Process, a Water Purifier, and a Fuel Cell to aid in allowing of longer missions or longer time on Orbit to take place. The last thing that's included is a rather healthy seven hundred (700) units of Electric Charge that will last a crew of three (3) roughly three (3) hours. If the standard version of the ECS doesn't seem to meet your needs, or even exceeds them, we allow you the opportunity to design your own ECS and tune it to your exact needs!
