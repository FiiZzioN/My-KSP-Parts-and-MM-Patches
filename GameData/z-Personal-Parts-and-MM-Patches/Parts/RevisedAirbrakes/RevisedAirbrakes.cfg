	@description = After several complaints from our brave pilots that the standard A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S. were too powerful and that the new, smaller variant wasn't strong enough. To finally appease everyone, engineers at C7 Aerospace made an airbrake that isn't large, but isn't small. You could say that it's just right.
