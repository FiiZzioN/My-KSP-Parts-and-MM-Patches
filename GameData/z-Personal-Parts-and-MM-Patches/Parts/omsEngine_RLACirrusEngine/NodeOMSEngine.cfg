	@description = When The O-10 Engine was first unveiled, it wasn't made from the RLA's MPR-5 "Cirrus" MonoPropellant Engine. Well, now it is! This was totally a collaboration between the two organizations and not just a rip off. Now you can have a MonoPropellant engine that has the same power as the "Puff" engine without having the horrible alignment issues! What this means is that, for the first time ever, you can have a relatively decent "Small Stack MonoPropellant Engine".
