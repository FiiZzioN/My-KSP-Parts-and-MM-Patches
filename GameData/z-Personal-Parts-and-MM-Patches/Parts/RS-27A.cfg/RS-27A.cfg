    @manufacturer = Rocketdyne
    @description = The RS-27A is a liquid-fuel rocket engine developed by Rocketdyne for use on the first stage of the Delta II and Delta III launch vehicles. It provides 629 kilonewtons of thrust burning LiquidFuel and Oxidizer in a gas-generator cycle. The engine is a modified version of its predecessor, the RS-27; its thrust nozzle has been extended to increase its area ratio from 8:1 to 12:1, which provides greater efficiency at altitude. The earlier RS-27 was derived from surplus Rocketdyne H-1 engines used in the Saturn 1B launcher.
