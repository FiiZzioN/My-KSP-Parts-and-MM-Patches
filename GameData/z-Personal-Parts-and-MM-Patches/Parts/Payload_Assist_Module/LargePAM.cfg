description = This Solid Rocket Motor is aptly named the Payload Assist Module (PAM for short) because, as the name suggests, it assists in the launching payload in many ways depending what the goal is for the mission at hand. The PAM is a very versatile asset to have at your disposal. One example is if you're trying to loft your payload into orbit but the launch vehicle doesn't have enough energy by itself, a PAM could then be used to finalize the orbital insertion. Another area where the PAM really shines is its ability to boost a payload from a parking orbit, and then insert it into a high energy elliptical transfer orbit. The reason a PAM is used over other options is because its cheaper, lighter, and has less moving parts than Liquid Fueled Engines meaning higher reliability.
